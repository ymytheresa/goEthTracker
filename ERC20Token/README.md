# ERC20 Token Monitor CLI

## Project Overview

ERC20 Token Monitor CLI is a command-line interface application designed to interact with and monitor ERC20 tokens on a local Ethereum network (Ganache). This tool allows users to deploy ERC20 tokens, transfer tokens between addresses, check balances, and monitor token transactions.

## Features

- Deploy new ERC20 tokens
- Transfer tokens between addresses
- Check token balances
- Monitor token transactions in real-time
- Subscribe to specific addresses for transaction notifications
- View transaction history for addresses
- Display token statistics

## Stage of Development

**Current Stage: Early Development**

This project is in its initial stages of development. The basic structure and core functionalities are being implemented. As of now, the following components are in progress:

- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Basic CLI framework
- [ ] ERC20 token deployment functionality
- [ ] Token transfer implementation
- [ ] Balance checking feature
- [ ] Transaction monitoring system
- [ ] Address subscription mechanism
- [ ] Transaction history retrieval
- [ ] Token statistics display

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or higher
- Access to a local Ethereum network (e.g., Ganache)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/erc20-token-monitor-cli.git

./erc20-monitor transfer --from 0x123... --to 0x456... --amount 100

# Check balance
./erc20-monitor balance --address 0x123...

# Start monitoring transactions
./erc20-monitor monitor

# Subscribe to an address
./erc20-monitor subscribe --address 0x789...

# View transaction history
./erc20-monitor history --address 0x123...

# Display token statistics
./erc20-monitor stats
```
